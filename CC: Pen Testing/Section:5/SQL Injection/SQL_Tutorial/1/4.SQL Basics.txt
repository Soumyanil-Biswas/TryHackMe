Structured Query Language (SQL):
----------------------------------

✓ SQL is a language used for interacting with Relational Database Management Sytems 
  (RDBMS)

  ✓ We can use SQL to get the RDBMS to do things for you 

  	* Create, retrieve, update and delete data
  	* Create and manage databases
  	* Design and create database tables
  	* Perform administration tasks (security, user management, import/export, etc)

✓ SQL implen=mentations vary between systems

	✓ Not all RDBMS' follow the SQL standard to a 'T'

	✓ The concepts are the same but the implementation may vary


NOT that much IMP. but ONLY know.

✓ SQL is actually a hybrid language, it's basically 4 types of languages in one.

	✓ Data Query Language (DOL)

		* Used to query the database for information.
		* Get information that is already stored there.

	✓ Data Defination Language (DDL)

		* Used for defining database schemas.

	✓ Data Control Language (DCL)

		* Used for controlling access to the data in the database.
		* User & permissions management. -----------------------> just like in linux.

	✓ Data Manipulation Language (DML)

		* Used for inserting, updating and deleting data from the database



Queries:
---------

✓ A query is a set of instructions given to the RDBMS (written is SQL) that tell the 
  RDMS  what information you want it to retrieve for you

  ✓ TONS of data in a DB

  ✓ OFten hidden in a complex schema

  ✓ Goal is to only get the data you need


  Table = employee

  name, age, salary = Columns in the table.


  SELECT employee.name, employee.age

  FROM employee

  WHERE employee.salary > 3000;
