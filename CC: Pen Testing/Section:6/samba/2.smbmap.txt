Continuing with the trend of tools having "map" in the name being extremely popular, smbmap isone of the best ways to enumerate samba. smbmap allows pen-testers to run commands (given proper permissions), download and upload files, and overall is just incredibly useful for smb enumeration.

1. How do you set the username to authenticate with?

------> -u

2. What about the password? 

------> -p

3. How do you set the host?

------> -H

4. What flag runs a command on the server(assuming you have permissions that is)?

------> -x

5. How do you specify the share to enumerate?

-----> -s

6. How do you set which domain to enumerate?

-----> -d

7. What flag downloads a file?

-----> --download

8. What about uploading one?

-----> --upload

9. Given the username "admin", the password "password", and the ip "10.10.10.10", how would you run ipconfig on that machine

-----> smbmap -H "10.10.10.10" -u "admin" -p "password" -x "ipconfig"
