Task1: What are "strings"?
---------------------------

From a programming perspective, "strings" is the term given for data handled by an application. At a broader view, these pieces of data are used to store information such as text to numerical values.

For example, let's say we have an application such as a calculator. A user will have to input two numerical values (e.g. 1 and 5) combined with an operator (e.g. + or plus) addition in this case. These values will be stored as "strings".

However "strings" can be stored within the application itself - where no input is necessary from the user. For example, using the example of usernames and passwords is a great representation of the many types of information that may be stored as a "string".

<ins>Why are "strings" important?</ins>

We're all security-minded people here and know that writing down passwords isn't a very smart thing to do. However, developers are not quite so likeminded and often leave credentials in applications which are often essential i.e. An application that server needs to know the IP address of it. Arguably, an IP address is trivial in comparison to the sensitivity of a password - but both would be stored as strings.

There are a plethora of examples of companies storing sensitive information such as passwords within their applications. For example, [Intellian](https://www.intelliantech.com/), a satellite-communications focused company had the disclosure of their "Aptus Web 1.24" application retaining a default passcode of “12345678”.

Illustrated below is an example of an Android Application containing sensitive credentials within strings:

Task3:  Strings in the Context of Malware
------------------------------------------

Great, developers can be lazy - they leave passwords in applications as we have previously discussed. How does that relate to us as a malware analyst? Well...

We've discovered that even professional developers can "slip up" a few times, malware authors are still developers at the end of the day.

But more specifically, malware types such as botnets and ransomware rely upon information being stored within strings I.e. IP Addresses so that they are able to "call home" and connect to their "Command and Control" (C&C) server.

A famous example is the "Wannacry" ransomware. The "killswitch" was a domain that was discovered as a value contained within a string.

As we will later come on to discover, building a picture of the various stages a piece of malware proceeds through is essential to prevent further infection. Information such as who the software communicates to I.e. IP Addresses such as in the case of a botnet, or the payment address in the instances of ransomware is prevalent in building this picture.

Task4:  Practical: Finding Bitcoin Addresses in Ransomware (Deploy!)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

#### <ins>What is Bitcoin?</ins>

At a brief overview, Bitcoin is an "anonymous" online payment currency in the sense that there is no direct attribution between the sender and recipient. Authors of ransomware use this currency because of this trait - however, just because there is no attribution such as real names like traditional payment methods, it is traceable by Law Enforcement (albeit difficult).

For example, Wannacry uses Bitcoin as the payment method for the decryption of files. Bitcoin uses virtual wallets, similar to a MAC address of a network interface card.

I.e. The Bitcoin address used by the authors of Wannacry was [13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94](https://live.blockcypher.com/btc/address/13AM4VW2dhxYgXeQepoHkHSQuy6NgaEb94/)

You can use a website such as [BlockCypher](https://live.blockcypher.com/) to explore the Bitcoin network and transactions between wallets.
