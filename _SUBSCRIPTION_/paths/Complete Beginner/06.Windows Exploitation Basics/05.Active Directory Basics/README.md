Task 1  Introduction
---------------------
Active Directory is the directory service for Windows Domain Networks. It is used by many of today's top companies and is a vital skill to comprehend when attacking Windows.

It is recommended to have knowledge of basic network services, Windows, networking, and Powershell.

#### NOTE:
The detail of specific uses and objects will be **limited** as this is _only a general overview of Active Directory_.

> **For more information on a specific topic look for the corresponding room or do your own research on the topic**.


### What is Active Directory?

Active Directory is a collection of machines and servers connected inside of domains, that are a collective part of a bigger forest of domains, that make up the Active Directory network. Active Directory contains many functioning bits and pieces, a majority of which we will be covering in the upcoming tasks.

To outline what we'll be covering take a look over this list of Active Directory ***components*** and become familiar with the various pieces of Active Directory: 
	- Domain Controller
	- Forests, Trees, Domains
	- Users + Groups
	- Trusts
	- Policies
	- Domain Service

All of these parts of Active Directory come together to make a big network of machines and servers. Now that we know what Active Directory is let's talk about the why?


NOTE:
> All these are brief explanations of Active directory... Refer Notebook For detailed indepth knowledge.


### Why use Active Directory?

The majority of large companies use Active Directory beacuse _it allows for the control and monitoring of their user's computers through_ **a single domain controller**.

It allows a single user to sign in to any computer on the active directory network and have access to his or her stored files and folders in the server, as well as the local storage on that machine.

This allows for any user in the company to use any machine that the company owns, without having to set up multiple users on a machine. _Active Directory does it all for you_.


Now that we know the what and the why of Active Directory let's move on to how it works and functions.



Task 2  Physical Active Directory
----------------------------------

The physical Active Directory is the servers and machines on-premise, these can be anything from domain controllers and storage servers to domain user machines; everything needed for an Active Directory environment besides the software.

</p>


#### Domain Controllers


A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest.
Domain controllers are the center of Active Directory -- they control the rest of the domain.

I will outline the tasks of a domain controller below: 

	- holds the AD DS data store 
	- handles authentication and authorization services 
	- replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
	- Allows admin access to manage domain resources



<p align="center">
  <img src="pic2.png?raw=true" alt="pic2.png"/>
</p>



#### AD DS Data Store

The Active Directory Data Store holds the _databases_ and _processes_ needed to store and manage directory information such as users, groups, and services.

Below is an outline of some of the contents and characteristics of the AD DS Data Store:

- Contains the NTDS.dit - a database that contains ***all of the information of an Active Directory domain controller*** as well as **password hashes for domain users**
- Stored by default in **`%SystemRoot%\NTDS`**
- accessible only by the _domain controller_


Fullform of NTDS.dit - `NT Directory Services. Directory Information Tree`


1. What database does the AD DS contain?

--> NTDS.dit

2. Where is the NTDS.dit stored?

--> %SystemRoot%\NTDS

3. What type of machine can be a domain controller?

--> windows server



Task 3  The Forest
-------------------

The forest is what defines everything.
It is the container that holds all of the other bits and pieces of the network together.
Without the forest all of the other trees and domains would not be able to interact.

The one thing to note when thinking of the forest is to not think of it too literally -- it is a physical thing just as much as it is a figurative thing.

When we say **`"forest"`**, it is only _a way of describing the connection created between these trees and domains by the network_.

<p align="center">
  <img src="pic3.png?raw=true" alt="pic3.png"/>
</p>


#### Forest Overview

A forest is a collection of one or more domain trees inside of an Active Directory network. It is what categorizes the parts of the network as a whole.


The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

1. **Trees** - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
2. **Domains** - Used to group and manage objects 
3. **Organizational Units(OUs)** - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
4. **Trusts** - Allows users to access resources in other domains
5. **Objects** - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
6. **Domain Services** - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
7. **Domain Schema** - Rules for object creation


1. What is the term for a hierarchy of domains in a network?

--> tree

2. What is the term for the rules for object creation?

--> Domain Schema

3. What is the term for containers for groups, computers, users, printers, and other OUs?

--> Organizational Units


Task 4  Users + Groups
-----------------------

The users and groups that are inside of an Active Directory are up to you.
When you create a domain controller it comes with default groups and two default users: 
	1. Administrator 
	2. and guest

It is up to you to create new users and create new groups to add users to.


#### Users Overview

Users are the core to Active Directory.

Then, without users why have Active Directory in the first place?

There are four main types of users you'll find in an Active Directory network.

##### NOTE:
However, there can be more depending on how a company manages the permissions of its users.


The four types of users are:

- **Domain Admins**
This is the big boss: they control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controller.

- **Service Accounts (Can be Domain Admins)**
These are for the most part never used except for service maintenance, they are required by Windows for services such as SQL to pair a service with a service account

- **Local Administrators**
These users can make changes to local machines as an administrator and may even be able to control other normal users, but they cannot access the domain controller.

- **Domain Users**
These are your everyday users. They can log in on the machines they have the authorization to access and may have local administrator rights to machines depending on the organization.



#### Groups Overview

Groups make it easier to give permissions to users and objects by organizing them into groups with specified permissions.


There are two overarching types of Active Directory groups: 

1. **Security Groups** - These groups are used to specify permissions for a large number of users

2. **Distribution Groups** - These groups are used to specify _email distribution lists_. As an attacker these groups are less beneficial to us but can still be beneficial in enumeration


#### Default Security Groups

There are a lot of default security groups so I won't be going into too much detail of each past a brief description of the permissions that they offer to the assigned group.

Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

- Domain Controllers - All domain controllers in the domain
- Domain Guests - All domain guests
- Domain Users - All domain users
- Domain Computers - All workstations and servers joined to the domain
- Domain Admins - Designated administrators of the domain
- Enterprise Admins - Designated administrators of the enterprise
- Schema Admins - Designated administrators of the schema
- DNS Admins - DNS Administrators Group
- DNS Update Proxy - DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
- Allowed RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group can have their passwords replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
- Group Policy Creator Owners - Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
- Denied RODC Password Replication Group - Members in this group cannot have their passwords replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
- Protected Users - Members of this group are afforded additional protections against authentication security threats. See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=298939 for more information.
- Cert Publishers - Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the directory
- Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the domain
- Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers - Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the enterprise
- Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the domain.
- Enterprise Key Admins - Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects within the forest.
- Cloneable Domain Controllers - Members of this group that are domain controllers may be cloned.
- RAS and IAS Servers - Servers in this group can access remote access properties of users


1. Which type of groups specify user permissions?

--> Security Groups

2. Which group contains all workstations and servers joined to the domain?

--> Domain Computers

3. Which group can publish certificates to the directory?

--> Cert Publishers

4. Which user can make changes to a local machine but not to a domain controller?

--> Local Administrators


**Domain Admin**: ***Big Boss*** [control the domains and are the only ones with access to the domain controlle]

5. Which group has their passwords replicated to read-only domain controllers?

--> Allowed RODC Password Replication Group



Task 5  Trusts + Policies
--------------------------

Trusts and policies go hand in hand to help the domain and trees communicate with each other and maintain "_security_" inside of the network.

They put the rules in place of how the domains inside of a forest can interact with each other, how an external forest can interact with the forest, and the overall domain rules or policies that a domain must follow.


<ins>Domain Trusts Overview</ins>

Trusts are a mechanism in place for users in the network to gain access to other resources in the domain.

For the most part, trusts outline the way that the domains inside of a forest communicate to each other, in some environments trusts can be extended out to external domains and even forests in some cases.


<p align="center">
  <img src="pic4.png?raw=true" alt="pic4.png"/>
</p>


There are two types of trusts that determine how the domains communicate:

- Directional - The direction of the _trust flows_ from a **trusting domain** to a **trusted domain**

- Transitive - The trust relationship _expands beyond_ just two domains to include other trusted domains.


The type of trusts put in place _determines_ how the **domains and trees in a forest** are able to _communicate_ and _send data to_ and from each other when attacking an Active Directory environment you can sometimes **abuse** these trusts in order to move **`laterally`** throughout the network.


<ins>Domain Policies Overview</ins>

1. Policies are a very big part of Active Directory, they dictate how the server operates and what rules it will and will not follow.

2. You can think of domain policies like domain groups, except instead of permissions they contain rules, and instead of only applying to a group of users, the policies apply to a domain as a whole. 

3. They simply act as a rulebook for Active  Directory that a domain admin can modify and alter as they deem necessary to keep the network running smoothly and securely.

4. Along with the very long list of default domain policies, domain admins can choose to add in their own policies not already on the domain controller.

For eg:
If you wanted to disable windows defender across all machines on the domain you could create a new group policy object to disable Windows Defender.

**`The options for domain policies are almost endless and are a big factor for attackers when enumerating an Active Directory network.`**


I'll outline just a few of the  many policies that are default or you can create in an Active Directory environment:

- Disable Windows Defender - Disables windows defender across all machine on the domain
- Digitally Sign Communication (Always) - Can disable or enable SMB signing on the domain controller


1. What type of trust flows from a trusting domain to a trusted domain?

--> Directional 

2. What type of trusts expands to include other trusted domains?

--> Transitive



Task 6  Active Directory Domain Services + Authentication
-----------------------------------------------------------

The Active Directory domain services are the core functions of an Active Directory network.

they allow for management of the domain, security certificates, LDAPs, and much more.


<ins>Domain Services Overview</ins>

see: [Intro to windows room](https://github.com/reveng007/TryHackMe/tree/main/_SUBSCRIPTION_/paths/Complete%20Beginner/06.Windows%20Exploitation%20Basics/03.Intro%20to%20Windows)

> There are many similar topics in that room, like: Kerberos, LDAP, NTLM.


Domain Services are exactly what they sound like.
They are services that the domain controller provides to the rest of the domain or tree.
There is a wide range of various services that can be added to a domain controller.

however, in this room we'll only be going over the default services that come when you set up a Windows server as a domain controller.

	- LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol; provides communication between applications and directory services

	- Certificate Services - allows the domain controller to create, validate, and revoke public key certificates

	- DNS, LLMNR, NBT-NS - Domain Name Services for identifying IP hostnames


<ins>Domain Authentication Overview</ins>

The most important part of Active Directory -- as well as the most vulnerable part of Active Directory -- is the authentication protocols set in place.


There are two main types of authentication in place for Active Directory:

1. NTLM
2. Kerberos

Since these will be covered in more depth in later rooms we will not be covering past the very basics needed to understand how they apply to Active Directory as a whole.

For more information on NTLM and Kerberos check out the Attacking Kerberos room - https://tryhackme.com/room/attackingkerberos.

	- Kerberos - The default authentication service for Active Directory uses ticket-granting tickets and service tickets to authenticate users and give users access to other resources across the domain.

	- NTLM - default Windows authentication protocol uses an encrypted challenge/response protocol


**The Active Directory domain services are the main access point for attackers and contain some of the most vulnerable protocols for Active Directory, this will not be the last time you see them mentioned in terms of Active Directory security.**


1. What type of authentication uses tickets? 

--> kerberos

2. What domain service can create, validate, and revoke public key certificates?

--> Certificate service


Task 7  AD in the Cloud
------------------------

Recently there has been a shift in Active Directory pushing the companies to cloud networks for their companies.

 The most notable AD cloud provider is Azure AD. Its default settings are much more secure than an on-premise physical Active Directory network; however, the cloud AD may still have vulnerabilities in it. 


<p align="center">
  <img src="pic5.png?raw=true" alt="pic5.png"/>
</p>


<ins>Azure AD Overview</ins>

**Azure** acts as _the middle man_ between your `physical Active Directory` and `your users' sign on`. 


<p align="center">
  <img src="pic6.png?raw=true" alt="pic6.png"/>
</p>



<ins>Cloud Security Overview</ins>

The best way to show you how the cloud takes security precautions past what is already provided with a physical network is to show you a comparison with a cloud Active Directory environment: 



<p align="center">
  <img src="pic7.png?raw=true" alt="pic7.png"/>
</p>


This is only an overview of Active Directory in the cloud so we will not be going into detail of any of these protocols; however, I encourage you to go out and do your own research into these cloud protocols and how they are more secure than their physical counterparts, and if they themselves come with vulnerabilities.


1. What is the Azure AD equivalent of LDAP?

--> Rest APIs

2. What is the Azure AD equivalent of Domains and Forests?

--> Tenants

3. What is the Windows Server AD equivalent of Guests?

--> Trusts

Task 8  Hands-On Lab
---------------------

1. `cd Downloads` - navigate to the directory PowerView is in
2. `powershell -ep bypass` - load a powershell shell with execution policy bypassed
3. `. .\PowerView.ps1` - import the PowerView module

In step 3: What we did is we executed `PowerView` i.e. in language of powershell, we imported **PowerView** module to our current environment. To use it's funcationalities.

We didn't import it in the 1st hand, we would get an error:
```
