	- Under **Shares**, are the _default share of Windows_, **C$**, and _default remote administration shares created by Windows_, such as **ADMIN$**.


	- Under **Sessions**, you will see a _list of users_ who are currently connected to the **shares**.

	- All the folders and/or files that _the connected users access_ will list under **Open Files**.


2. The Local Users and Groups section you should be familiar with from [Windows Fundamentals 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx) because it's `lusrmgr.msc`.


3. In **Performance**, you'll see a utility called **Performance Monitor** (`perfmon`).


4. **Device Manager** allows us to view and configure the hardware, such as disabling any hardware attached to the computer.


5. **Storage**

i.  *Windows Server Backup* --> Specific to windows server only not for win10
ii. *Disk Management*


Disk Management is a system utility in Windows that enables you to perform advanced storage tasks.  Some tasks are:

- Set up a new drive
- Extend a partition
- Shrink a partition
- Assign or change a drive letter (ex. E:) 


6. **Services and Applications**

Recall from the previous task; a service is a special type of application that runs in the background. Here you can do more than enable and disable a service, such as view the Properties for the service. 

WMI Control configures and controls the **Windows Management Instrumentation** (WMI) service.



Per Wikipedia, "WMI allows scripting languages (such as VBScript or Windows PowerShell) to manage Microsoft Windows personal computers and servers, both locally and remotely. Microsoft also provides a command-line interface to WMI called Windows Management Instrumentation Command-line (WMIC)."

#### Note:
The WMIC tool is deprecated in Windows 10, version 21H1. Windows PowerShell supersedes this tool for WMI.

Task5:  System Information

File name: `msinfo32.exe`

In the Software Environment section, you can see information about software baked into the operating system and software you have installed. Other details are visible in this section as well, such as the **Environment Variables** and **Network Connections**.

1. **Environment Variable**

Per Microsoft, 
"Environment variables store information about the operating system environment. This information includes details such as the operating system path, the number of processors used by the operating system, and the location of temporary folders.

The environment variables store data that is used by the operating system and other programs.
For example, the WINDIR environment variable contains the location of the Windows installation directory. Programs can query the value of this variable to determine where Windows operating system files are located".


Click on `Environment Variables` to see the assigned values for the virtual machine.
