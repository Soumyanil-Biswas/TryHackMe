Task2:  Windows Updates
--------------------------

1. There were two definition updates installed in the attached VM. On what date were these updates installed?

--> 5/3/2021


Task3:  Windows Security
--------------------------

Per Microsoft, "Windows Security is your home to manage the tools that protect your device and your data".

**Windows Security** can be opened in 2 ways:

1. Win key > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security
2. Win key > Windows Security

Under **Windows Security**:

	- Virus & threat protection
	- Firewall & network protection
	- App & browser control
	- Device security


Each following task will briefly touch on these areas.

Before proceeding, let's provide a quick comment on the status icons.

	- Green means your device is sufficiently protected, and there aren't any recommended actions.
	- Yellow means there is a safety recommendation for you to review.
	- Red is a warning that something needs your immediate attention.


1. In the above image, which area needs immediate attention?


--> virus & Threat protection


Task4:  Virus & threat protection
----------------------------------

How to open:

1. Win key > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Virus & Threat protec...
2. Win key > Windows Security > Virus & Threat Protec...
3. Win key > Virus & Threat Protec...


Virus & threat protection is divided into two parts:

	- **Current threats**
	- **Virus & threat protection settings**


#### <ins>Current threats</ins>

**Scan options**

	- <ins>Quick scan</ins> - Checks folders in your system where threats are commonly found.
	- <ins>Full scan</ins> - Checks all files and running programs on your **hard disk**. This scan could take longer than one hour.
	- <ins>Custom scan</ins> - Choose which files and locations you want to check.
	- <ins>Microsoft Defender Offline scan</ins> - Some malicous software can be particularly difficult to remove from your device. Microsoft Defender Offline can help find and remove them using up-to-date threat definitions. This will restart your device and will take about 15 minutes.


**Threat history**

#### NOTE:
Note: Since the attached VM is a **Windows Server 2019** edition, it looks different from a **Windows 10 Home** or **Professional** edition. 

	- <ins>Last scan</ins> - Windows Defender Antivirus automatically scans your device for viruses and other threats to help keep it safe.
	- <ins>Quarantined threats</ins> - Quarantined threats have been isolated and prevented from running on your device. _They will be periodically removed_.
	- <ins>Allowed threats</ins> - Allowed threats are items identified as threats, which you allowed to run on your device.


#### <ins>Virus & threat protection settings</ins>


<ins>**Manage settings**</ins>

- **Real-time protection**

Locates and stops malware from installing or running on your device.

- **Cloud-delivered protection**

Provides increased and faster protection with access to the latest protection data in the cloud.

- **Automatic sample submission**

Send sample files to Microsoft to help protect you and others from potential threats. 

- **Controlled folder access**

Protect files, folders, and memory areas on your device from unauthorized changes by unfriendly applications.

- **Exclusions**

Windows Defender Antivirus won't scan items that you've excluded.

- **Notifications**

Windows Defender Antivirus will send notifications with critical information about the health and security of your device.


***Warning***: Excluded items could contain threats that make your device vulnerable. Only use this option if you are ***100%*** sure of what you are doing.


####<ins>Virus & threat protection updates</ins>

	- **Check for Updates** - Manually check for updates to update Windows Defender Antivirus definitions.

####<ins>Ransomware protection</ins>

	- **Controlled folder access** - Ransomware protection requires this feature to be enabled, which in turn requires Real-time protection to be enabled.


**Note**: Real-time protection is turned off in the attached VM to decrease the chances of performance issues. Since the VM can't reach the Internet and there aren't any threats in the VM, this is safe to do. Real-time protection should definitely be enabled in your personal Windows devices unless you have a 3rd party product that provides the same protection. Ensure it's always up-to-date and enabled.

**Tip**: You can perform on-demand scans on any file/folder by right-clicking the item and selecting 'Scan with Microsoft Defender'.


1. Specifically, what is turned off that Windows is notifying you to turn on in VM?

--> Real-time protection



Task5:  Firewall & network protection
--------------------------------------

How to open:

1. Win key > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Firewall & network protection.
2. Win key > Windows Security > Firewall & network protection
3. Win key > Firewall & network protection


What is the difference between the 3 (**Domain**, **Private**, and **Public**)?

- **Domain** - The domain profile applies to networks where the host system can authenticate to a domain controller. 
- **Private** - The private profile is a user-assigned profile and is used to designate private or home networks.
- **Public** - The default profile is the public profile, used to designate public networks such as Wi-Fi hotspots at coffee shops, airports, and other locations.


***Allow an app through firewall***

![](windows-firewall3.png?raw=true)

You can view what the current settings for any firewall profile are. In the above image, several apps have access in the Private and/or Public firewall profile. Some of the apps will provide additional information if it's available via the `Details` button.


***Advanced Settings***

![](windows-firewall4.png?raw=true)

Configuring the **Windows Defender Firewall** is for advanced Windows users. Refer to the following Microsoft documentation on best practices [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/best-practices-configuring).

**Tip:** Command to open the Windows Defender Firewall is `WF.msc`


1. If you were connected to airport Wi-Fi, what most likely will be the active firewall profile?

--> public network


Task6:  App & browser control
-------------------------------

How to open:

1. Win key > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > App & Browser Control
2. Win key > Windows Security > App & Browser Control
3. Win key > App & Browser Control


In this section, you can change the settings for the **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen**.

Per Microsoft, "_Microsoft Defender SmartScreen protects against phishing or malware websites and applications, and the downloading of potentially malicious files_".

Refer to the official Microsoft document for more information on Microsoft Defender SmartScreen [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview).


#### <ins>Check apps and files</ins>

- **Windows Defender SmartScreen** helps protect your device by checking for unrecognized apps and files from the web.

![](windows-smartscreen.png?raw=true)


#### <ins>Exploit protection</ins>

- Exploit protection is built into Windows 10 (and, in our case, Windows Server 2019) to help protect your device against attacks.


Task7:  Device security
------------------------

How to open:

1. Win key > Settings > Update & Security > Windows Security > Device Security
2. Win key > Windows Security > Device Security
3. Win key > Device Security


<ins>**Core isolation**</ins>

- **Memory Integrity** - Prevents attacks from inserting malicious code into high-security processes.

The below images are from another machine to show another security feature that should be available in a personal Windows 10 device.

<ins>**Security processor**</ins>

![](windows-sec-processor.png?raw=true)

Below are the **Security processor details**.

![](windows-tpm.png?raw=true)


What is the **Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**?

Per Microsoft:
"Trusted Platform Module (TPM) technology is designed to provide hardware-based, security-related functions.

A TPM chip is a secure crypto-processor that is designed to carry out cryptographic operations.

The chip includes multiple physical security mechanisms to make it tamper-resistant, and malicious software is unable to tamper with the security functions of the TPM".








Task8:  BitLocker
------------------

What is **BitLocker**?

Per Microsoft:
"BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers".

On devices with **TPM installed**, **BitLocker offers the best protection**.

Per Microsoft:
"BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later.
The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers.
It works with BitLocker to help protect user data and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline".

Refer to the official Microsoft documentation to learn more about BitLocker [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/information-protection/bitlocker/bitlocker-overview).
