What is bash?

Bash is a scripting language that runs within the terminal on most Linux distros, as well as MacOS. Shell scripts are a sequence of bash commands within a file, combined together to achieve more complex tasks than simple one-liner and are especially useful when it comes to automating sysadmin tasks such as backups.
