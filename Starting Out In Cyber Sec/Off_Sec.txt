The first large area within Cyber Security is the offensive side. This area involves attacking different applications and technologies to discover vulnerabilities.

This career is for you if:

✓ you enjoy understanding how things work
✓ you are analytical
✓ you like thinking out of the box

The most common offensive security job role is a penetration tester. A penetration tester is an individual that is legally employed by an organisation to find vulnerabilities in their products. A penetration tester usually requires a broad range of knowledge including:

✓ web application security
✓ network security
✓ use of programming languages to write various scripts

More recently, cloud security has also been gaining popularity as various organisations are now shifting their infrastructure to cloud providers such as AWS and Azure.

It's also possible to have a speciality in one of these topics, however a broad knowledge is the best way to start out.

To help you build this broad knowledge set, we have
