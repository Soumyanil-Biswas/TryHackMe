Moved to backup directory (gobuster)

Downloaded backup.zip -----> we would get: priv.key, CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg


$ gpg --import priv.key

$ gpg --decrypt CustomerDetails.xlsx.gpg > CustomerDetails.xlsx


we got the password in excel spread sheet

Unfortunatly these are not ssh creds


Then are used to enumerate FTP

Put the revshell and executed it to get a shell as apache

Then elivated to paradox with creds we got but the shell we got is not stable

Lets login via ssh, We do it via key-based auth...

We willcopy out .pub key to trgt machine's authorised_keys file

Then: ssh paradox@ip

Found nothing, started linpeas ---> wget was not installed so used curl to download

Saw that nfs was running and linpeas reposted a vuln ----> no_root_squash
