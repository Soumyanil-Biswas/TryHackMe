"... If the connection does not exist (CLOSED) then a reset-acknowledge(RST/ACK) packet is sent in response to any incoming segment except another reset.  In particular, SYNs addressed to a non-existent connection are rejected by this means."

In other words, if Nmap sends a TCP request with the SYN flag set to a closed port, the target server will respond with a TCP packet with the RST/ACK (Reset/Acknowledge) flag set ( A Reset packet is simply one with no payload and with the RST bit set in the TCP header flags) and ACK flag, both ACK and RST flags are within same packet, is sent to acknowledge what ever packet was sent before to the receiver by the sender. By this response, Nmap can establish that the port is CLOSED.

 ✓   If, however, the request is sent to an open port, the target will respond with a TCP packet with the SYN/ACK flags set. Nmap      then marks this port as being open (and completes the handshake by sending back a TCP packet with ACK set).

     This is all well and good, however, there is a third possibility.

 ✓   What if the port is open, but hidden behind a firewall?

     Many firewalls are configured to simply drop incoming packets. Nmap sends a TCP SYN request, and receives nothing back. This      indicates that the port is being protected by a firewall and thus the port is considered to be filtered.

     That said, it is very easy to configure a firewall to respond with a RST TCP packet. For example, in IPtables for Linux, a        simple version of the command would be as follows:

     iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport <port> -j REJECT --reject-with tcp-reset
