Did nmap scan ---> got port 31337 (binary file for BOF)

		   port 139 --> netbios
		
		   port 3389 --> RDP (I was at 1st brute forcing RDp with
					hydra)

		But no solutions at all!!!

Became quite suspecious abt this...


Then saw smb was open...

Searched for it : smb enumeration

see: https://www.hackingarticles.in/a-little-guide-to-smb-enumeration/

[ Add Process ]

I got the binary to download, then transferred it to win10 for testing in
immunity dbg for BOF

Rename the files by manually viewing them.....

NOTE!!
I FOUND THAT Renaming should be exactly same as done
