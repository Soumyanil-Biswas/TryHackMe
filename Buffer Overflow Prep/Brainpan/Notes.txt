Later I found while using '-sV' and 'A' flags with nmap: 

SimpleHTTPServer is running in port 10000

I  went to the website to see, but saw a html page hosted

so, I used gobuster to find files, I found /bin/ => then went to 

that directory to find the executable: brainpan.exe

Which we can analyse in Immunity dbg for testing



trgt: 10.10.176.243

test: 10.0.2.45

0x005ff700
0x005ffae0

Crashed at 992 bytes

EIP offset --> 520

ret: 

0x311712f3 => lSB -> \xf3\x12\x17\x31


After gaining access, I bash files , I was shocked !!! => In windows, linux
files???

=> then used : cat checkserv.sh  ---> Then saw that wine is running !!!


changed payload from windows to linux as exe file was 32 bit => linux is x86



Got shell using nc as well as exploit/multi/handler listener


Then escalated using GTFO bin:

sudo /home/anansi/bin/anansi_util manual man ==> !/bin/bash
