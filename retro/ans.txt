There are two distinct paths that can be taken on Retro. 

One requires significantly less trial and error, however, both will work. 

Please check writeups if you are curious regarding the two paths. 
An alternative version of this room is available in it's remixed version Blaster.

1. A web server is running on the target. What is the hidden directory which the website lives on?

---> /retro

2. user.txt

HINT: Don't leave sensitive information out in the open, even if you think you have control over it. 

------> 3b99fbdc6d430bfb51c72c651a261927

step1:

Just like the same as Blaster

3. root.txt

------> 7958b565d7bd88d10c6f22d1c4063
