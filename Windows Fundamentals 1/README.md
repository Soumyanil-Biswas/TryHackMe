see: [file and folder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/bb727008(v=technet.10))


#### How can you view the permissions for a file or folder?
S1.
> Right-click the file or folder you want to check for permissions.
S2.
> From the context menu, select `Properties`.
S3.
> Within Properties, click on the `Security` tab.
S4.
> In the `Group or user names` list, select the user, computer, or group whose permissions you want to view.


1. What is the meaning of NTFS?

--> New Technology File System


### NOTE:

> Another feature of `NTFS` is `Alternate Data Streams (ADS)`.

> `Alternate Data Streams (ADS)` is a file attribute specific to `Windows NTFS (New Technology File System)`.

> Every file has at least one data stream ($DATA), and ADS allows files to contain more than one stream of data. Natively Window Explorer doesn't display ADS to the user. There are 3rd party executables that can be used to view this data, but Powershell gives you the ability to view ADS for files.

> From a `security` perspective, malware writers have used ADS to `hide data`.

> Not all its uses are malicious. For example, when you download a file from the Internet, there are _identifiers written to ADS_ to identify that the file was 
_downloaded_ from the Internet.

> **`ADS`** was originally intended to store **`macintosh`** File

> Intersting facts ðŸ˜ˆ:

> --> In one of the video, it was told that **`ADS`** doesn't change a file's checksum, but I found that it changed the checksum of the file.

Task5: The Windows\System32 Folders
------------------------------------

1. What is the system variable for the Windows folder?

--> %windir%

Task6: User Accounts, Profiles, and Permissions
------------------------------------------------

User accounts can be one of two types on a typical local Windows system: **`Administrator`** & **`Standard User`**.

1. An `Administrator` can make changes to the **system**: 

a. add users
b. delete users
c. modify groups
d. modify settings on the system, etc. 

2. A `Standard User` can only make changes to folders/files attributed to the user & can't perform system-level changes, such as install programs.


#### Adding User to Windows10 system:

1. Settings > Accounts > Other Users > Add someone else to this PC (opens Local User and Group Management) > right click 


shortcut to open --> Local User and Group Management: **`lusrmgr.msc`**


NOTE:  A Standard User will not see this option (Add someone else to this PC)


1. What is the name of the other user account?

--> tryhackmebilly

2. What groups is this user a member of?

--> Remote Desktop Users, Users

3. What built-in account is for guest access to the computer?

--> Guest

4. What is the account status ?

--> Account is disabled


Task7: User Account Control
----------------------------


NOTE:
> Elevated privilege increases the risk of system compromise because it makes it easier for malware to infect the system. Consequently, since the user account can make changes to the system, the malware would run in the context of the logged-in user.

##### To protect the local user with `such privileges`, Microsoft introduced User 
`Account Control (UAC)`. This concept was first introduced with the short-lived Windows Vista and continued with versions of Windows that followed.


Note: `UAC (by default)` doesn't apply for the `built-in local administrator account`.
