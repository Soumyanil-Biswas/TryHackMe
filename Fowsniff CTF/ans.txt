Task 1: Hack into the FowSniff organisation.


PORT         SERVICE  VERSION
22/tcp  ---->  ssh  (OpenSSH 7.2p2 Ubuntu 4ubuntu2.4(Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp  ---->  http (Apache httpd 2.4.18 (Ubuntu))
110/tcp ---->  pop3 (Dovecot pop3d)
143/tcp ---->  imap (Dovecot imapd)


Visiting website:

I found this:

The attackers were also able to hijack our official @fowsniffcorp Twitter account. All of our official tweets have been deleted and the attackers may release sensitive information via this medium. We are working to resolve this at soon as possible.

So, I went to the twitter account: @fowsniffcorp

And found the pastbin text and downloaded it

extracted only the hash from that file : 
$ cat FowsniffCorp.txt | sed -n 's/.*://p' > hashes.txt

Now Icracked all of that in crackstation:

8a28a94a588a95b80163709ab4313aa4 ------> mailcall

f7fd98d380735e859f8b2ffbbede5a7e -----> 07011972


Then copy the above hash-pass combination in a text file

and the use : cat pass.txt | cut -d " " -f 3

to extract the password and save them in pass.txt file

Also make username text file

Then used: auxiliary/scanner/pop3/pop3_login to bruteforce pop3 service

Got it:
seina:scoobydoo2

Dear All,

A few days ago, a malicious actor was able to gain entry to
our internal email systems. The attacker was able to exploit
incorrectly filtered escape characters within our SQL database
to access our login credentials. Both the SQL and authentication
system used legacy methods that had not been updated in some time.

We have been instructed to perform a complete internal system
overhaul. While the main systems are "in the shop," we have
moved to this isolated, temporary server that has minimal
functionality.

This server is capable of sending and receiving emails, but only
locally. That means you can only send emails to other users, not
to the world wide web. You can, however, access this system via 
the SSH protocol.

The temporary password for SSH is "S1ck3nBluff+secureshell"   <----- pass ssh

------------------> so, now what is the username......???

You MUST change this password as soon as possible, and you will do so under my
guidance. I saw the leak the attacker posted online, and I must say that your
passwords were not very secure.

Come see me in my office at your earliest convenience and we'll set it up.

Thanks,
A.J Stone

Devin,

You should have seen the brass lay into AJ today!
We are going to be talking about this one for a looooong time hahaha.
Who knew the regional manager had been in the navy? She was swearing like a sailor!

I don't know what kind of pneumonia or something you brought back with
you from your camping trip, but I think I'm coming down with it myself.
How long have you been gone - a week?
Next time you're going to get sick and miss the managerial blowout of the century,
at least keep it to yourself!

I'm going to head home early and eat some chicken soup. 
I think I just got an email from Stone, too, but it's probably just some
"Let me explain the tone of my meeting with management" face-saving mail.
I'll read it when I get back.

Feel better,

Skyler

PS: Make sure you change your email password. 
AJ had been telling us to do that right before Captain Profanity showed up.
