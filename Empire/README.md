## Powershell Empire

`Empire`, a `C2` or `Command and Control server` created by `BC-Security`, used to deploy agents onto a device and remotely run modules. Empire is a free and open-source alternative to other command and control servers like the well known `Cobalt Strike C2`. In this room, we will cover the basics of setting up a listener and stager as well as what types are available, then learn how to use an agent on a device.
